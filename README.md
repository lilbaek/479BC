<<<<<<< HEAD
Augustus is a fork of the Julius project that intends to incorporate gameplay changes.
=======
The aim of this project is to provide enhanced, customizable gameplay to Caesar 3 using project Julius UI enhancements.

Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 and Julius saves, however saves made with Augustus **will not work** outside Augustus.

Gameplay enhancements include:
- Roadblocks
- Market special orders
- Global labour pool
- Partial warehouse storage
- Increased game limits
- Zoom controls
- And more!

Because of gameplay changes and additions, save files from Augustus are NOT compatible with Caesar 3 or Julius. Augustus is able to load Caesar 3 save files, but not the other way around. If you want vanilla experience with visual and UI improvements, or want to use save files in base Caesar 3, check [Julius](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius).

Augustus, like project Julius requires the original assets (graphics, sounds, etc) from Caesar 3 to run.
It optionally [supports the high-quality MP3 files](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/MP3-Support) once provided on the Sierra website.
=======
Julius is a fully working open-source version of Caesar 3, with the same logic
as the original, but with some UI enhancements, that can be played on multiple platforms.

Julius will not run without the original Caesar 3 files. You can buy a digital copy from [GOG](https://www.gog.com/game/caesar_3) or
[Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/517790/Caesar_3/), or you can use an original CD-ROM version.

The goal of the project is to have exactly the same game logic as Caesar 3, with the same look
and feel. This means that the saved games are 100% compatible with Caesar 3, and any gameplay bugs
present in the original Caesar 3 game will also be present in Julius.

Enhancements for Julius include:
- Support for widescreen resolutions
- Windowed mode support for 32-bit desktops
- A lot of small in-game [quality of life improvements](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/Improvements-from-Caesar-3)
- Support for the [high-quality MP3 files](https://github.com/bvschaik/julius/wiki/MP3-Support) once provided on the Sierra website

While Julius does not implement any gameplay changes, a fork of Julius named [Augustus](https://github.com/Keriew/julius) is implementing many long-wanted gameplay changes, such as roadblocks.
Beware: Augustus does not support the original Caesar 3 save files, while Julius does. So use Julius for a more vanilla experience with some visual improvements, or Augustus for a different gameplay experience.

## Running the game

First, download the game for your platform from the list above.

Alternatively, you can build Augustus yourself. Check [Building Julius](doc/BUILDING.md)
for details.

Then you can either copy the game to the Caesar 3 folder, or run the game from an independent
folder, in which case the game will ask you to point to the Caesar 3 folder.

Note that you must have permission to write in the game data directory as the saves will be
stored there.

See [Running](doc/RUNNING.md) for further instructions and startup options.

## Bugs

See the list of [Bugs & idiosyncrasies](doc/bugs.md) to find out more about some known bugs.
