Julius GC is a fork of the Julius project that intends to incorporate gameplay changes.

Julius requires the original assets (graphics, sounds, etc) from Caesar 3 to run.
It optionally [supports the high-quality MP3 files](doc/mp3_support.md) once provided on the
Sierra website.

## Running the game

First, download the game for your platform from the list above.

Alternatively, you can build Julius yourself. Check [Building Julius](doc/BUILDING.md)
for details.

Then you can either copy the game to the Caesar 3 folder, or run the game from an independent
folder, in which case the game will ask you to point to the Caesar 3 folder.

Note that you must have permission to write in the game data directory as the saves will be
stored there.

See [Running](doc/RUNNING.md) for further instructions and startup options.

## Bugs

Julius recreates many bugs that you can find in original Caesar 3 game, to preserve 100% saves compatibility. See the list of [Bugs & idiosyncrasies](doc/bugs.md) to find out more.
